The course will examine the interrelationship between manufacturing machines, processes, and systems, with a close look at the flow of information between and across these realms, enabled by advances in IoT and Analytics. The course will pay special attention to the role of design in manufacturing and will examine feedback loops with product design. Finally, key concepts of Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing will be discussed with industrial case studies.
