## Summary

 Industry 4.0 refers to a fundamental shift in global manufacturing, powered by advances in automation, computing, and data. This course surveys the field of Industry 4.0, focusing on advances in manufacturing processes, processes, and systems, a.k.a Smart Manufacturing. The course ties the fundamentals in these areas to the current state-of-the-art, with an examination of where technology is evolving to in the future. 

The course will examine the interrelationship between manufacturing machines, processes, and systems, with a close look at the flow of information between and across these realms, enabled by advances in IoT and Analytics. The course will pay special attention to the role of design in manufacturing and will examine feedback loops with product design. Finally, industrial case studies will be presented to illustrate Industry 4.0 at work and the implementation challenges companies face in putting these technologies to work. ‘

The course will equip learners to understand and appreciate the complexity of manufacturing today, and help identify opportunities to push its frontiers. 

## Topics

1. Overview of Industrial transformations, from Industry 1.0 to 4.0
2. Fundamentals of manufacturing machines, processes, and systems
3. Advances in manufacturing machines, processes, and systems

7. Integrating design and manufacturing, including design automation and optimization 
8. Industry 4.0 case studies.

**Survey of Manufacturing Technology**: We will sweep through multiple topics related to Manufacturing Technology, with the aim of introducing you to a broad set of concepts. The idea is _not_ to delve deep into any of these topics, but to provide a sufficient introduction to several of them, so that you can come back later in your academic/professional careers to learn more when you need it. Our goal is to help you build an _index_ of these technologies so that they are familiar for you to come back to.

**Machines**: What are the fundamentals of designing _machines_ that are used for making things? How well you can make something is dependent on how well you have designed the machine to make it. And how well something is designed is directly related to how it addresses the various sources of error that we need to contend with in mechanical system design. 

**Processes**: What are the fundamental manufacturing processes that our machines will be applied in? This includes additive, subtractive, and conservative. How do you choose processes based on constraints of cost, time, complexity, and material?

**Systems**: How do multiple processes come together to actually deliver a complex artifact at the right place and right time? Manufacturing systems are vast orchestrations across space and time of complex engineering systems to make things available when you need them. This can be as complex as your cell phone, manufactured across a vast supply chain around the world, or a simple plastic sleeve for that cellphone, that is -- wait for it -- still made in a vast supply chain around the world. 

**Inter-relationships and flow of information**: How are *machines*, *processes*, and *systems* related? This is the crux of the course and we will be coming back to this many times. These inter-relationships are manifested by the flows of information across the domains – information on how the machines are operating are used to make changes to the processes; process outputs impact the manufacturing systems they are a part of; and so on.  

**IoT and Analytics**: The Internet of Things makes it simply to instrument and collect vast amounts of data across every-*thing* in the manufcturing ecosystem: from the machines that make things, to the things themselves, to the vast network of support players (logistics, warehouses, etc.,) that bring it all together. How do we analyze data from the IoT using the flow of information leveraging techniques such as Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to improve machines, systems, and processes? 

**Feedback Loops with Product Design**: Manufacturing cannot be viewed as an activity in isolation – it is closely related to Product Design – part design constrains and is constrained by how it can be (potentially) manufactured, and understanding the feedback between design and manufacturing is critical for developing new products.  

**Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing**: These refer to a clutch of technologies that taken together can potentially transform Industrial Manufacturing. What are these technologies, how mature are they in their development, and what can we do with them?

**Case Studies**: What can we learn from the successes and failures (more interesting) of others?
