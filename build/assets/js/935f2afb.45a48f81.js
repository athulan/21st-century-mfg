The course ties fundamentals in these areas to the current state-of-the-art, with an examination of where technology is evolving to in the future. The course will examine the interrelationship between manufacturing machines, processes, and systems, with a close look at the flow of information between and across these realms, enabled by advances in IoT and Analytics. The course will pay special attention to the role of design in manufacturing and will examine feedback loops with product design. Finally, key concepts of Industry 4.0 and Smart Manufacturing will be discussed with industrial case studies. The course will equip learners to understand and appreciate the complexity of manufacturing in the 21 century, and help identify opportunities to push its frontiers.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"lectures/lecture-01":{"id":"lectures/lecture-01","title":"Lecture 1","description":"Important things go here.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"lectures/lecture-02":{"id":"lectures/lecture-02","title":"Lecture 2","description":"Important things go here.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"lectures/lecture-03":{"id":"lectures/lecture-03","title":"Lecture 3","description":"Important things go here.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"lectures/lecture-04":{"id":"lectures/lecture-04","title":"Lecture 4","description":"Important things go here.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"lectures/lecture-05":{"id":"lectures/lecture-05","title":"Lecture 5","description":"Important things go here.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"lectures/lecture-06":{"id":"lectures/lecture-06","title":"Lecture 6","description":"Important things go here.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
